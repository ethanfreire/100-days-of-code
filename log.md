# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

### Day 1: November 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finally manage to create my models and routes and got passing simple get and post HTTP method for users and products. Can't wait to learn more on middleware tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Definetly feel that using cornell note taking method to write something down on paper while listening to tutorial helps me keep track of what is covered and helps ADHD brain stay focused.
